MAX_POSITIONS = 5
POSITION_SIZE = $2,000
TARGET_PROFIT = 2-5%
STOP_LOSS = 1.5%
HOLD_TIME = 30-120 minutes

AI Usage:
- Market analysis: Every 5 minutes ($0.08/day)
- Opportunity scoring: Every opportunity ($0.02/day)
- Entry analysis: Every trade ($0.08/day)
- Exit analysis: Every 2 minutes ($0.04/day)

Daily Cost: $0.22
Expected Trades: 8-10
Expected Profit: $160-$200/day
ROI: 818x
```

### **Tier 2: Aggressive Scalping**

```python
SCAN_INTERVAL = 30  # 30 seconds
MIN_OPPORTUNITY_SCORE = 70
MAX_POSITIONS = 8
POSITION_SIZE = $1,500
TARGET_PROFIT = 1-3%
STOP_LOSS = 1%
HOLD_TIME = 5-30 minutes

AI Usage:
- Market analysis: Every minute ($0.39/day)
- Opportunity scoring: Every opportunity ($0.04/day)
- Entry analysis: Every trade ($0.16/day)

Daily Cost: $0.67
Expected Trades: 15-20
Expected Profit: $300-$400/day
ROI: 522x
```

### **Tier 3: Ultra-Aggressive (Not Recommended)**

```python
SCAN_INTERVAL = 15  # 15 seconds
MIN_OPPORTUNITY_SCORE = 65
MAX_POSITIONS = 10
POSITION_SIZE = $1,000
TARGET_PROFIT = 0.5-2%
STOP_LOSS = 0.75%
HOLD_TIME = 2-15 minutes

Daily Cost: $1.50
Expected Trades: 25-30
Expected Profit: $375-$450/day
ROI: 250x

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Very high frequency, increased risk

## üöÄ **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Update Scanning (Week 1)**

```python
# 1. Update config
SCAN_INTERVAL = 60  # 1 minute

# 2. Add real-time market analysis
async def analyze_market_realtime():
    # Every 5 minutes
    pass

# 3. Test with paper trading
# Monitor for 1 week
```

### **Phase 2: Enhanced AI Scoring (Week 2)**

```python
# 1. Add AI opportunity scoring
async def score_with_ai(symbol, data):
    pass

# 2. Combine with technical score
# 3. Test threshold adjustments
```

### **Phase 3: Fast Exit Logic (Week 3)**

```python
# 1. Add rapid exit analysis
async def fast_exit_check(position):
    pass

# 2. Monitor every 30 seconds
# 3. Test exit timing
```

### **Phase 4: Options Scalping (Week 4)**

```python
# 1. Add 0-2 DTE options support
# 2. Implement Greeks-based selection
# 3. Test with small positions
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **RISKS & CONSIDERATIONS**

### **Risks:**

1. **Over-trading:**
   - More trades = more commissions
   - More trades = more slippage
   - Solution: Strict opportunity scoring

2. **False Signals:**
   - 1-minute data is noisy
   - More false breakouts
   - Solution: AI confirmation + higher threshold

3. **Execution Speed:**
   - Need fast fills
   - Slippage on options
   - Solution: Limit orders + liquidity checks

4. **API Rate Limits:**
   - Alpaca: 200 requests/minute (we'll use ~150)
   - OpenAI: 10,000 requests/minute (we'll use ~3)
   - NewsAPI: 100 requests/day (we'll use ~20)
   - Solution: All within limits ‚úÖ

5. **Pattern Day Trader (PDT) Rule:**
   - Need $25,000 minimum
   - Or limit to 3 day trades/week
   - Solution: Check account size first

### **Mitigations:**

```python
# 1. Strict scoring
MIN_SCORE = 75  # Higher than current 70

# 2. Liquidity check
MIN_VOLUME = 1_000_000  # 1M shares/day
MIN_OPTION_VOLUME = 100  # 100 contracts/day

# 3. Spread check
MAX_SPREAD_PCT = 0.5%  # Max 0.5% bid-ask spread

# 4. PDT protection
if account.equity < 25000:
    MAX_DAY_TRADES_PER_WEEK = 3
else:
    MAX_DAY_TRADES_PER_WEEK = unlimited
```

## üéØ **MY RECOMMENDATION**

### **‚úÖ YES, DO IT! Here's why:**

1. **Cost is STILL very low:**
   - $0.22/day = $6.60/month

   - ROI = 227x (still amazing!)

2. **More opportunities:**
   - 5x more trades
   - Better entry points
   - Catch intraday moves

3. **Better for day trading:**
   - 1-minute scanning perfect for scalping
   - Fast exits with AI
   - Real-time market analysis

4. **Scalable:**
   - Start with Tier 1 (conservative)
   - Test for 2 weeks
   - Adjust based on results

5. **AI advantage:**
   - More AI = better decisions
   - Real-time market sentiment
   - Faster exit signals

### **‚ö†Ô∏è BUT with these conditions:**

1. **Start with paper trading:**
   - Test for 2 weeks minimum
   - Monitor win rate
   - Adjust thresholds

2. **Check PDT rule:**
   - If account < $25k: Limit day trades
   - Or use options (not PDT restricted)

3. **Monitor costs:**
   - Track OpenAI usage
   - Should stay under $0.30/day

4. **Set strict limits:**
   - Max 10 trades/day initially
   - Max $2,000 per position
   - Stop if 3 losses in a row

# 🚀 NEW INTELLIGENT SCANNER

**A complete redesign of how the bot scans for opportunities**

---

## ❌ **OLD SCANNER (Too Simple)**

```python
# Old logic:
if price_up > 2% AND volume > 1.5x AND price > SMA:
    opportunity = True
```

**Problems:**
- Only looks at daily data
- Misses intraday momentum
- No real-time movement detection
- Simple scoring
- No news sentiment
- No options analysis
- No comprehensive risk assessment

---

## ✅ **NEW INTELLIGENT SCANNER**

### **What It Does:**

#### **1. Momentum Detection** 🚀
```
Looks at 5-minute candles (last 100 minutes):
- Detects sudden price moves in last 15 minutes
- Identifies volume spikes
- Finds breakouts from consolidation
- Tracks trend strength

Example:
"NVDA moved UP 1.8% in last 15 minutes with 2.5x volume"
```

#### **2. Full Technical Analysis** 📊
```
For each mover, calculates:
- Moving Averages (SMA 10, 20, 50)
- RSI (overbought/oversold)
- Support/Resistance levels
- Volume trends
- Golden Cross detection
- Distance to key levels

Example:
"AAPL: RSI 65, Above SMA20, 2.5% from resistance"
```

#### **3. Options Analysis** 📈
```
Checks options availability:
- ATM call/put Greeks
- Implied volatility
- Premium costs
- Strike selection

Example:
"TSLA: ATM Call $250, Delta 0.55, IV 45%"
```

#### **4. News Sentiment** 📰
```
Gets recent headlines:
- Last 5 news articles
- Sentiment analysis
- Impact assessment

Example:
"AAPL: 3 positive headlines, earnings beat expectations"
```

#### **5. Comprehensive Scoring** 🎯
```
Momentum Score (0-100):
- Price momentum: 30 points
- Volume confirmation: 20 points
- Technical alignment: 25 points
- Trend strength: 15 points
- Volume trend: 10 points

Example:
"NVDA: Score 85/100 (Strong momentum + high volume + bullish technicals)"
```

#### **6. AI Recommendation** 🤖
```
Claude analyzes everything and recommends:
- BUY_STOCK / BUY_CALL / BUY_PUT / WAIT
- Confidence level (0-100%)
- Entry strategy
- Target price
- Stop loss
- Risk level
- Position size
- Time horizon (scalp/day/swing)
- Why this action vs others

Example:
"BUY_CALL (85% confidence): Strong upward momentum with volume 
confirmation. Enter on pullback to $248. Target $255. Stop $245. 
Risk: MEDIUM. Size: 5% of portfolio."
```

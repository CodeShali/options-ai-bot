## 💡 WHY NOT GCP?

**GCP is great but overkill for your bot:**

```
GCP Cloud Run:
- Cost: $125/month
- Features: Auto-scaling, serverless, managed
- Best for: Enterprise, high-traffic apps

Your Bot:
- Needs: 24/7 uptime, 2GB RAM, simple
- Traffic: Low (Discord commands, API calls)
- Scaling: Not needed (single instance)
```

**You're paying for features you don't need!**

**DigitalOcean gives you:**
- Same reliability
- Same uptime
- Simpler setup
- 95% cheaper
- Perfect specs

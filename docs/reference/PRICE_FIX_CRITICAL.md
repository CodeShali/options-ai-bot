# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX: STOCK PRICES WERE HALF OF ACTUAL!

**Date:** October 12, 2025 16:52:00  
**Severity:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🐛 THE BUG

### **Problem:**
Stock prices were showing **HALF** of the actual price!

### **Examples:**
```
AAPL: Showed $121.25 → Should be $242.50 ❌
SPY:  Showed $319.36 → Should be $638.71 ❌
PLTR: Showed $176.44 → Correct ✅
```

---

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE

### **The Issue:**
After-hours quotes from Alpaca have **$0.00 ask prices**.

### **Old Logic:**
```python
price = (bid + ask) / 2  # Mid price
```

### **What Happened:**
```
AAPL:
  Bid: $242.50
  Ask: $0.00  ← After-hours, no ask!
  
Old Calculation:
  price = (242.50 + 0.00) / 2 = $121.25  ❌ WRONG!
```

### **Why PLTR Was Correct:**
PLTR had both bid ($173) and ask ($179.88), so mid-price worked correctly.

---

## ✅ THE FIX

### **New Logic:**
```python
# Handle after-hours quotes where ask might be 0
if ask == 0 and bid > 0:
    price = bid  # Use bid price when ask is 0 (after-hours)
elif bid == 0 and ask > 0:
    price = ask  # Use ask price when bid is 0
elif bid > 0 and ask > 0:
    price = (bid + ask) / 2  # Normal mid-price
else:
    price = 0  # Both are 0, no valid price
```

### **Now Works:**
```
AAPL:
  Bid: $242.50
  Ask: $0.00
  
New Calculation:
  price = bid = $242.50  ✅ CORRECT!
```

## 📊 BEFORE vs AFTER

### **Before Fix:**
```
AAPL: $121.25  ❌ (50% of actual)
SPY:  $319.36  ❌ (50% of actual)
PLTR: $176.44  ✅ (correct by chance)
TSLA: $415.51  ✅ (had both bid/ask)
MSFT: $509.00  ✅ (had both bid/ask)
```

### **After Fix:**
```
AAPL: $242.50  ✅ CORRECT!
SPY:  $638.71  ✅ CORRECT!
PLTR: $176.44  ✅ CORRECT!
TSLA: $415.51  ✅ CORRECT!
MSFT: $509.00  ✅ CORRECT!
```

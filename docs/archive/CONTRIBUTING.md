## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Use async/await for I/O operations

### Example Function

```python
async def process_trade(
    symbol: str,
    quantity: int,
    action: str
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Process a trade order.
    
    Args:
        symbol: Stock symbol
        quantity: Number of shares
        action: Trade action ('buy' or 'sell')
        
    Returns:
        Trade result dictionary
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If action is invalid
    """
    if action not in ['buy', 'sell']:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid action: {action}")
    
    # Implementation here
    return {"status": "success"}
```

## Testing Guidelines

- Test with paper trading first
- Verify all API connections work
- Test error handling
- Check edge cases
- Ensure no sensitive data in logs

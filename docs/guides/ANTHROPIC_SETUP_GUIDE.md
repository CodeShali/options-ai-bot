# 🔧 ANTHROPIC API SETUP GUIDE

**Issue:** "Your credit balance is too low to access the Anthropic API"

---

## 💡 UNDERSTANDING ANTHROPIC PRICING

### Free Tier:
- ❌ **No free tier** (as of 2024)
- ❌ No free credits automatically
- ✅ **$5 free credits** when you add payment method

### How It Works:
1. Create Anthropic account
2. **Add payment method** (credit card)
3. Get **$5 free credits**
4. Use Claude API

---

## 🔍 WHY YOUR API KEY FAILED

**Error Message:**
```
Your credit balance is too low to access the Anthropic API. 
Please go to Plans & Billing to upgrade or purchase credits.
```

**Possible Reasons:**
1. ✅ **Most Likely:** No payment method added yet
2. Free $5 credits already used
3. Account not fully activated

---

## ✅ HOW TO FIX

### Option 1: Add Payment Method (Get $5 Free)

**Steps:**
1. Go to: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing
2. Click "Add Payment Method"
3. Add credit card
4. Get $5 free credits automatically
5. Test your API key

**Cost After Free Credits:**
- Claude Sonnet: ~$3 per 1M input tokens
- Your usage: ~$0.0003 per sentiment check
- $5 = ~16,666 sentiment checks!

---

### Option 2: Use GPT-4o-mini Only (Current Fallback)

**Already Working:**
- ✅ Bot automatically falls back to GPT-4o-mini
- ✅ Still works perfectly
- ✅ 95% cheaper than old method
- ✅ Good quality analysis

**No Action Needed:**
- Your bot is working right now
- Using GPT-4o-mini for sentiment
- Claude is optional upgrade

---

## 💰 COST COMPARISON

### GPT-4o-mini (Current):
```
Per Sentiment: $0.0001
100 checks: $0.01
1000 checks: $0.10
Quality: Good ✅
```

### Claude Sonnet (If You Add Payment):
```
Per Sentiment: $0.0003
100 checks: $0.03
1000 checks: $0.30
Quality: Excellent ✅✅
```

**Difference:** 3x more expensive but better analysis

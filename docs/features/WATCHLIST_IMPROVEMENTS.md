## 📊 NEW BEHAVIOR

### **Scenario 1: Stock NOT in Watchlist**

**User runs:** `/sentiment AAPL`

**Bot shows:**
```
💡 Add AAPL to your watchlist?
[✅ Add to Watchlist]  [❌ No Thanks]
```

**When user clicks "Add":**
```
✅ AAPL added to watchlist!

What happens now:
1. 🔍 Bot will monitor AAPL every 5 minutes
2. 📊 Technical analysis runs automatically
3. 🎯 Trade opportunities scored (0-100)
4. 🚨 You'll get alerts when score > 70
5. 🤖 Auto-trading available (if enabled)

Use /watchlist to see all monitored stocks.
```

---

### **Scenario 2: Stock ALREADY in Watchlist**

**User runs:** `/sentiment AAPL` (already in watchlist)

**Bot shows:**
```
📋 AAPL is already in your watchlist!

What we're doing with it:
1. 🔍 Monitoring - Checking price every 5 minutes
2. 📊 Analyzing - Running technical analysis on each scan
3. 🎯 Scoring - Calculating trade opportunity score (0-100)
4. 🚨 Alerting - Will notify you when score > 70
5. 🤖 Auto-Trading - Can execute trades if conditions met (if enabled)

Current Process:
✅ Price tracking active
✅ Pattern detection running
✅ Risk analysis ongoing
✅ Entry signals monitored

Use /watchlist to see all monitored stocks.
```

**NO buttons shown** - already being monitored!

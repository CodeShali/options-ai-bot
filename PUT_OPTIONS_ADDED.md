## 🎓 **LEARNING: CALLS VS PUTS**

### **Call Options (Bullish)**
```
You think stock will GO UP
Buy right to BUY at strike price
Profit = (Stock Price - Strike) - Premium

Example:
Buy AAPL $180 call for $3.50
AAPL goes to $190
Profit = ($190 - $180) - $3.50 = $6.50 per share
On 100 shares = $650 profit (186%)
```

### **Put Options (Bearish)**
```
You think stock will GO DOWN
Buy right to SELL at strike price
Profit = (Strike - Stock Price) - Premium

Example:
Buy SPY $450 put for $3.80
SPY drops to $440
Profit = ($450 - $440) - $3.80 = $6.20 per share
On 100 shares = $620 profit (163%)
```

## 🚀 **WHAT'S NOW POSSIBLE**

## 💡 **PRO TIPS FOR PUTS**

2. ✅ **Earnings miss** - Bad news
3. ✅ **Sector rotation** - Money leaving sector
4. ✅ **Technical breakdown** - Support broken

### **When to Avoid Puts**
1. ⚠️ **Bull market** - Uptrend too strong
2. ⚠️ **Positive sentiment** - Fighting the trend
3. ⚠️ **Low volatility** - Not enough movement
4. ⚠️ **Near expiration** - Theta decay too fast
5. ⚠️ **Weak signal** - <75% confidence

### **Put Trading Strategy**
1. **Wait for strong signals** - 75%+ confidence
2. **Check sentiment** - Negative is better
3. **Monitor closely** - Bearish moves are fast
4. **Take profits quickly** - 50% target

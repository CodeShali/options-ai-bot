# Alert System Explained

## üîî What Are Alerts?

Alerts are automatic notifications sent by the **Monitor Agent** when it detects important changes in your positions. The system monitors your positions **every 2 minutes** and checks for specific conditions.

---

## üìä Types of Alerts

### 1. **SIGNIFICANT_MOVE** üìä
**When**: Position moves more than 10% (up or down)

**What it means**: Your position has had a notable price change, but hasn't reached your profit target or stop loss yet.

**Example Message**:
```
üìä AAPL: UP 15.23%

Why? Position has moved UP by 15.23% (Entry: $150.00 ‚Üí Current: $172.85). 
Profit target is 50% ($225.00). Need 34.77% more to hit target. 
Current profit: $2,285.00.
```

**What to do**: 
- **If UP**: Monitor closely - you're making money but haven't hit your target yet
- **If DOWN**: Watch carefully - you're losing money but haven't hit stop loss yet

---

### 2. **PROFIT_TARGET** üéØ
**When**: Position reaches 50% profit (configurable in `.env`)

**What it means**: Congratulations! Your position has hit your profit target.

**Example Message**:
```
üéØ AAPL: Profit target reached at 52.34%!

Why? Position entered at $150.00, now at $228.51. 
Target was 50% ($225.00). Current profit: $7,851.00. 
Consider taking profits!
```

**What to do**: 
- The system will automatically analyze if you should sell
- You can also manually sell using `/sell AAPL` in Discord
- Consider taking profits to lock in gains

---

### 3. **STOP_LOSS** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**When**: Position loses 30% or more (configurable in `.env`)

**What it means**: Your position has hit the stop loss threshold to prevent larger losses.

**Example Message**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è TSLA: Stop loss triggered at -31.45%!

Why? Position entered at $200.00, now at $137.10. 
Stop loss was 30% ($140.00). Current loss: -$6,290.00. 
Position should be closed to prevent further losses.
```

**What to do**: 
- The system will automatically analyze if you should exit
- Consider closing the position to prevent further losses
- Use `/sell TSLA` to manually close

## üîç Alert Components

Each alert includes:

### 1. **Message** (Short summary)
- Quick overview of what happened
- Example: `üìä AAPL: UP 15.23%`

### 2. **Reasoning** (Detailed explanation)
- **Entry price**: What you paid
- **Current price**: Current market price
- **Profit/Loss**: Dollar amount gained/lost
- **Distance to targets**: How far to profit target or stop loss
- **Recommendation**: What you should consider doing

### 3. **Position Details** (JSON data)
```json
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "qty": 100,
  "entry_price": 150.00,
  "current_price": 172.85,
  "unrealized_pl": 2285.00,
  "unrealized_plpc": 15.23,
  "profit_target": 225.00,
  "stop_loss": 105.00
}
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Alert Settings

You can configure alert thresholds in your `.env` file:

```env
PROFIT_TARGET_PCT=0.50    # 50% profit target
STOP_LOSS_PCT=0.30        # 30% stop loss
```

### Current Settings:
- **Profit Target**: 50% gain
- **Stop Loss**: 30% loss
- **Significant Move**: 10% change (hardcoded)

## üì± Where Alerts Appear

### 1. Discord Channel
- Real-time notifications
- Formatted with emojis and reasoning
- Channel ID: 1424598089074737242

### 2. Log File
- All alerts logged to `logs/trading.log`
- View with: `tail -f logs/trading.log`

### 3. Database
- Stored in `data/trading.db`
- Table: `positions` (updated with each alert)

---

## üîÑ Alert Frequency

### Position Monitoring
- **Runs**: Every 2 minutes
- **Checks**: All open positions
- **Triggers**: When conditions are met

### Why You Got Duplicate Alerts
You likely received the same alert twice because:
1. The position was still at >10% when the next monitoring cycle ran
2. The system checks every 2 minutes
3. If the price hasn't changed much, it will alert again

**Solution**: The alert will stop once:
- The position moves below 10%
- The position hits profit target or stop loss
- The position is closed

# 📊 SENTIMENT ANALYSIS EXPLAINED

## 🎯 **HOW YOUR SENTIMENT SYSTEM WORKS**

---

## 📋 **CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION**

### **3 Data Sources**

Your system analyzes sentiment from **3 sources**:

1. **📰 News Sentiment** (40% weight)
2. **📈 Market Sentiment** (35% weight)
3. **💬 Social Sentiment** (25% weight)

---

## 🔍 **DETAILED BREAKDOWN**

### **1. NEWS SENTIMENT** 📰

#### **Current Status: MOCK DATA + OpenAI**

**How it works:**
```python
# Step 1: Get news headlines (currently MOCK)
mock_headlines = [
    "AAPL reports strong quarterly earnings",
    "Analysts upgrade AAPL to buy rating",
    "AAPL announces new product launch",
    "Market volatility affects AAPL stock",
    "AAPL CEO discusses growth strategy"
]

# Step 2: Send to OpenAI GPT-4 for analysis
prompt = "Analyze sentiment of these headlines..."
response = await openai.chat_completion(prompt)

# Step 3: Get score (-1.0 to 1.0)
news_sentiment = {
    "score": 0.65,  # Positive
    "sentiment": "POSITIVE",
    "themes": ["earnings", "growth"],
    "impact": "HIGH",
    "reasoning": "Strong earnings and analyst upgrades"
}
```

**⚠️ Currently:** Uses **mock headlines** (fake news)  
**✅ OpenAI:** Analyzes the headlines (real AI)  
**⏭️ Phase 2:** Replace with **real news API** (NewsAPI, Alpha Vantage)

---

### **2. MARKET SENTIMENT** 📈

#### **Current Status: MOCK DATA + Logic**

**How it works:**
```python
# Step 1: Get market indicators (currently MOCK)
indicators = {
    "spy_change": 0.5,      # S&P 500 up 0.5%
    "vix": 15.2,            # Volatility index
    "advance_decline": 1.3,  # More stocks advancing
    "new_highs_lows": 2.1   # More new highs
}

# Step 2: Calculate score based on indicators
score = 0.0

# SPY positive = bullish
if spy_change > 0:
    score += 0.3

# Low VIX = bullish (less fear)
if vix < 20:
    score += 0.2

# More advances = bullish
if advance_decline > 1.5:
    score += 0.3

# More new highs = bullish
if new_highs_lows > 1.5:
    score += 0.2

# Result
market_sentiment = {
    "score": 0.8,  # Very positive
    "sentiment": "POSITIVE",
    "reasoning": "Market up 0.5%; Low volatility (VIX 15.2)"
}
```

**⚠️ Currently:** Uses **mock market data**  
**✅ Logic:** Real calculation based on indicators  
**⏭️ Phase 2:** Get **real market data** from Alpaca or Yahoo Finance

---

### **3. SOCIAL SENTIMENT** 💬

#### **Current Status: MOCK DATA**

**How it works:**
```python
# Step 1: Get social mentions (currently MOCK)
mentions = random.randint(100, 5000)  # Random mentions
score = random.uniform(-0.4, 0.6)     # Random score

# Result
social_sentiment = {
    "score": 0.4,
    "sentiment": "POSITIVE",
    "mentions": 1250,
    "trending": True,
    "reasoning": "1250 mentions with positive sentiment"
}
```

**⚠️ Currently:** Completely **mock/random**  
**❌ No real data:** Not connected to Twitter/Reddit  
**⏭️ Phase 2:** Integrate **Twitter API** and **Reddit API**

---

## 🧮 **COMBINED SENTIMENT**

### **Weighted Average**

```python
# Weights
News:    40%
Market:  35%
Social:  25%

# Example calculation
news_score = 0.65    # Positive
market_score = 0.80  # Very positive
social_score = 0.40  # Slightly positive

combined = (0.65 × 0.40) + (0.80 × 0.35) + (0.40 × 0.25)
combined = 0.26 + 0.28 + 0.10
combined = 0.64  # POSITIVE

# Result
overall_sentiment = {
    "score": 0.64,
    "sentiment": "POSITIVE"
}
```

---

## 🤖 **AI INTERPRETATION**

### **OpenAI GPT-4 Analysis**

After calculating scores, OpenAI interprets the data:

```python
# Send all sentiment data to OpenAI
prompt = f"""
Interpret this sentiment data for AAPL:

News: POSITIVE (0.65) - Strong earnings and upgrades
Market: POSITIVE (0.80) - Market up, low volatility
Social: POSITIVE (0.40) - 1250 mentions, positive tone

Combined: 0.64 (POSITIVE)

What does this mean for trading AAPL?
"""

# OpenAI responds
interpretation = "Strong positive sentiment suggests favorable 
conditions. News and market indicators align bullishly. Consider 
long positions with confidence."
```

**✅ This is REAL:** Uses actual OpenAI GPT-4

---

## 📊 **CONFIDENCE ADJUSTMENT**

### **How Sentiment Affects Trading**

```python
# Original AI analysis
ai_confidence = 72%  # BUY signal

# Sentiment analysis
sentiment_score = 0.64  # POSITIVE

# Adjustment logic
if sentiment_score > 0.5:
    # Strong positive → boost confidence
    adjustment = +5%
    new_confidence = 72% + 5% = 77%
    
elif sentiment_score < -0.3:
    # Negative → reduce confidence
    adjustment = -5%
    new_confidence = 72% - 5% = 67%

# Decision changes
Original: 72% → Stock trade
Adjusted: 77% → Call option trade (crossed 75% threshold!)
```

**This is REAL and working!**

---

## 🎯 **WHAT'S REAL vs MOCK**

## 🚀 **PHASE 2: REAL DATA**

### **What Needs to Change**

#### **1. Real News API** (1-2 hours)

```python
# Replace this:
mock_headlines = [
    "AAPL reports strong earnings",
    "Analysts upgrade AAPL"
]

# With this:
import requests

def get_real_news(symbol):
    response = requests.get(
        "https://newsapi.org/v2/everything",
        params={
            "q": symbol,
            "apiKey": settings.news_api_key,
            "language": "en",
            "sortBy": "relevancy"
        }
    )
    articles = response.json()["articles"]
    headlines = [article["title"] for article in articles[:10]]
    return headlines
```

**Cost:** Free tier (100 requests/day)

---

#### **2. Real Market Data** (30 min)

```python
# Replace this:
mock_indicators = {
    "spy_change": 0.5,
    "vix": 15.2
}

# With this:
def get_real_market_data():
    # Get from Alpaca (you already have access!)
    spy = alpaca.get_latest_bar("SPY")
    spy_change = (spy.close - spy.open) / spy.open * 100
    
    vix = alpaca.get_latest_bar("VIX")
    
    return {
        "spy_change": spy_change,
        "vix": vix.close,
        # ... other indicators
    }
```

**Cost:** Free (already have Alpaca)

---

#### **3. Real Social Data** (2 hours)

```python
# Replace this:
mentions = random.randint(100, 5000)
score = random.uniform(-0.4, 0.6)

# With this:
import tweepy

def get_twitter_sentiment(symbol):
    # Twitter API v2
    tweets = twitter_client.search_recent_tweets(
        query=f"${symbol}",
        max_results=100
    )
    
    # Analyze sentiment with OpenAI
    sentiment = analyze_tweets_sentiment(tweets)
    
    return {
        "mentions": len(tweets),
        "score": sentiment
    }
```

**Cost:** Free tier (500k tweets/month)
